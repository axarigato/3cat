      <p class="paragraph-48"><strong>Azalea</strong> - She was rescued after being abandoned by her mother and left on cold concrete, unable to open her eyes and with the umbilical cord still attached. His brother, who was rescued with him, died soon after, but thanks to his mother&#x27;s hard work in raising him and giving him lots of love, he grew up quickly. Joined her family in July 2010. Her birthday is May 13th. She is 14 years old. She is a proud tsundere queen. <br><br><strong>Ginnan</strong> - I rescued him when he was curled up in front of our house. Other than an injury to his leg and the fact that he was hungry, there was nothing unusual about him. We handed out flyers saying, ``We are taking care of a lost kitten,&#x27;&#x27; but the owner never showed up, and the kitten became our home. In November 2011, we became a family. His birthday is July 7th. He is 12 years old. He is super sweet and gluttonous.<br><br><strong>Onigiri</strong> - With the intention of helping a friend who was in trouble, we temporarily took him into our home and looked for foster parents, but in the end, we couldn&#x27;t let him go and he became our child. Her face is tough, but her voice is cute. He is a tsundere guy who suddenly changes when he is stroked. Joined his family in June 2018. His birthday is September 15th. He is 5 years old. He loves his older brother Ginnan fiercely.</p>
